# MemoryGame
Simple memory card game built using SwiftUI. The goal of the game is to keep as many points as possible by finding all matching cards.
If you take less than 15 tries to match all the cards, you only loose 5 points per guess, otherwise you loose 10. Players can also choose to cycle through different themes by tapping the wand icon, or can chose to start a new match by tapping the arrow icon.
